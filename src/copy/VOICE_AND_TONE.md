# Voice & Tone Guide

The FIT CHECK copy system enforces a **modern, classy, luxury** tone across all user touchpoints.

## Core Principles

### 1. Modern Minimalism
- **Short sentences**. No rambling.
- **Minimal punctuation**. Period or nothing.
- **Rare exclamation use**. Almost never. Reserved for true celebration.
- **No emoji overuse**. One per context, max.

### 2. Confident Calm
- **Action-first language**. "Save" not "Do you want to save?"
- **Direct statements**. No hedging with "maybe", "might", "try to"
- **Precise vocabulary**. "Calibrate" not "set up", "Reveal" not "show"

### 3. Luxury Aesthetic
- **Premium language**. "Collection" not "stuff", "Vault" not "closet"
- **Refined tone**. Never cheap, never loud
- **Sophisticated simplicity**. Elegance in brevity

## Writing Rules

### Buttons
- **1-2 words maximum**
- **Action verbs first**
- **Examples**: 
  - ✅ "Reveal Outfit"
  - ✅ "Save"
  - ✅ "Continue"
  - ❌ "Click here to reveal your outfit"
  - ❌ "Save this item to your wardrobe"

### Titles
- **2-5 words**
- **Confident, clear**
- **Examples**:
  - ✅ "Your Collection"
  - ✅ "Style Vault"
  - ✅ "Reveal today's fit"
  - ❌ "Here's where you can see all your clothes"

### Descriptions
- **Maximum 2 lines**
- **Precise, evocative**
- **Paint a picture, don't explain**
- **Examples**:
  - ✅ "A precise configuration of technical shells and obsidian bases"
  - ✅ "Personalized to your style and weather"
  - ❌ "This outfit was selected based on your wardrobe and the current weather conditions"

### Error Messages
- **Calm, precise, helpful**
- **NO panic language**
- **Examples**:
  - ✅ "Connection failed"
  - ✅ "Required fields missing"
  - ✅ "Camera permission needed"
  - ❌ "Oops! Something went wrong!"
  - ❌ "Error: Unable to establish connection to server"

### Empty States
- **Aspirational, minimal**
- **One clear CTA**
- **Examples**:
  - ✅ "No items yet" + [Add Item]
  - ✅ "Empty" (short variant)
  - ❌ "You don't have any items in your wardrobe yet. Why not add some?"

### Success Messages
- **Subtle acknowledgement**
- **No confetti language**
- **Examples**:
  - ✅ "Saved"
  - ✅ "Updated"
  - ✅ "Removed"
  - ❌ "Awesome! Your item has been saved successfully!"
  - ❌ "Yay! You did it!"

## Context-Specific Guidelines

### Authentication
- **Welcoming but not chatty**
- "Welcome back" NOT "Hey there! Great to see you again!"
- Keep legal text minimal, gray, small

### Onboarding
- **Aspirational promises**
- "Daily outfit suggestions" NOT "We'll help you pick what to wear"
- Show value, don't oversell

### Permissions
- **Clear need, simple ask**
- "Camera access required" + "Enable camera to add items"
- No guilt trips, no over-justification

### Loading States
- **Single word or short phrase**
- "Loading", "Processing", "Analyzing"
- NO spinny explanations

### Weather/Context Tags
- **Data-first, clean**
- "OPTIMIZED FOR 12°C // CLEAR"
- Technical, precise aesthetic

### User Identity
- **System-level formality**
- "IDENTITY: AUTH_REQUIRED"
- "USER: {id} // SECURE_SYNC"
- Feels like secure system, not consumer app

## Testing Your Copy

Before adding new copy, ask:

1. **Is it short enough?** (Can you cut 30%?)
2. **Is it confident?** (No "please", "try", "maybe"?)
3. **Is it calm?** (Would you say it in a library?)
4. **Is it luxury?** (Premium vocabulary?)
5. **Is it banned?** (Check banned phrases list)

## Examples: Before & After

### ❌ Before (Bad)
"Oops! We couldn't load your items. Please try again or check your internet connection!"

### ✅ After (Good)
"Connection failed"

---

### ❌ Before (Bad)
"Awesome! Your outfit has been saved to your favorites!"

### ✅ After (Good)

## Final Reminder

**Every word counts. Every word earns its place. If it doesn't serve the user or the tone, cut it.**
